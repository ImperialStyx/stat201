# _Impact of Tobacco Usage On Potential Heart Failure Patients_

## Statistical Analysis
- A comprehensive statistical analysis using R and Jupyter Notebook to investigate the relationship between tobacco usage and the risk of heart failure among potential patients.
- My analysis involved formulating hypotheses, performing hypothesis testing, and visualizing the results using various statistical techniques like asymptotic two sample t-tests and confidence intervals.
- This project allowed me to enhance my data analysis and statistical inference skills while contributing to our understanding of a critical health issue. It showcases my ability to use data-driven insights to inform decision-making and promote public health awareness.
